A trajectory of the Lorentz attractor is then used to associate each of these pieces of the recording to a point in the system’s phase space.

Replication of the genome during cellular reproduction proceeds in a way that is distinct from the creation of proteins. When a cell reproduces, a molecule called a DNA polymerase reads the DNA genome to create a copy of it, that is then transferred to the daughter cell. However, the copying is not generally perfect and can create errors or “mutations” in the chromosome. These mutations in turn, affect the production of proteins and their functionality in the cell.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: DNA Replication and mutations to the genotype.

Second, even for 2 nucleotides, there are a total of \\(4^2= 16\\) genotypes in this space. Bacterial genomes, or even individual genes are much longer, with a usual gene being around 100 nucelotides long. The genotype space of such a gene thus forms a immensely large space of \\(4^{100}\\) genotypes. Visualizing and working with such large spaces for the purpose of our demonstration is difficult. Instead, we abstract away the network details and consider a nicer, linear genotypes space.

    "text": "Fitness landscapes\nEach mutation can have different effects on the phenotype (i.e., the traits) of a newly created cell. For example, a mutation that affects the folding of an important metabolic protein can reduce the fitness of the organism. On the other hand, mutations can sometimes create surprising enhancements to fitness by allowing new or more efficient biochemical pathways to emerge. These mutations can also be neutral, having no effect on the fitness of the resulting organism (in fact, it is widely believed that most mutations that occur in biological organisms are neutral).\nMore concretely, fitness can be measured on an absolute scale where it is simply the rate of doubling of a cell when grown in isolation. Assuming we have a way to measure this fitness for every possible genotype, we can assign each node in the genotype space a fitness-value. This creates a fitness landscape that overlays the genotype space and over which populations evolve. Theoretical biologists generally use different models to approximate fitness landscapes. Additive landscapes, NK model, and the royal staircase landscape are some examples of these on a realistic high-dimensional genotype space.\nOn a one-dimensional genotype space however, we have very few options. In terms of complexity, there are essentially four different flavors of a fitness landscape determined by the correlation between adjacent fitness values.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The spectrum of one-dimensional fitness landscapes.

    "section": "How evolution works",
    "text": "How evolution works\nThe fitness landscape captures how organisms can change their strategy to survive in their. However, that is not the complete picture. A population is a group of organisms (and hence of genotypes) that exist in the same space and evolve on this landscape. The way these populations evolve is not always straightforward. For example, in the conventional “survival of the fitness” narrative, all members of a population should simply mutate to the fittest genotype on the landscape and stay there. However, both real fitness landscapes and the process of evolution is significantly more complex than this adage reveals.\nThe Wright-Fisher model is a simple algorithmic approach to evolution that attempts to capture some of this complexity. In this model, the population size is fixed and time passes in discrete steps or generations. Every generation, the genotypes present in the population are resampled with replacement—with a probability proportional to their fitness and frequency in the current generation—to reconstitute a new population with the same number of organisms. Mutations can be added to the model by changing the genotype with a small probability (\\(\\mu\\)) which stands for the mutation rate during replication.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The Wright-Fisher Model. Under this model, the set of new genotypes is drawn from the set of genotypes at the current generation through a two-step process. First, \\(N\\) genotypes are drawn from the population with a probability proportional to their fitness times their frequency in the population. Then, these sampled genotypes are mutated with a probability proportional to the mutation rate (\\(\\mu\\)) to their adjacent genotypes (in the genotype space).\n\n\n\nTwo genotypes\nThe following simulation models the Wright-Fisher process for a two-genotype space (called A and B) with a finite population size and mutation rate. Try modifying the sliders to see how the population reacts to a change in the relative fitness of B to A, the population size, and the mutation rate.\n\nEven in this simple simulation, some interesting things can be noted about the nature of the evolutionary process. For example,\n\nSmall populations have much stronger demographic noise compared to large populations (i.e., when we lower the population size, the fluctuations in population fractions are much larger).\nIf the population size is large enough (to reduce demographic noise), increasing the relative fitness of B increases the fraction of population that has the B genotype. This difference is amplified if you decrease the mutation rate.\nEven when the fitnesses of B and A are exactly equal, one of the genotypes can achieve fixation (i.e. becomes the only genotype in the population, this phenomena is generally referred to as genetic drift). This is especially true when the population size is small and mutation rate is low.\n\n\n\nMany genotypes\nThe model can be easily extended to a multiple genotypes. The following simulation models \\(k\\) different genotypes with fitness values drawn from a normal distribution with finite variance. The translucent red bars show the relative fitness values while the blue bars denote the fraction of organisms having a particular genotype.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the populations in this model shows an interesting behavior sometimes called a “wandering phenomenon”. This occurs when the mutation rate, the population sizes, and the fitness differences between genotypes are relatively small such that the spread of the population in the space is much smaller than the number of genotypes. In this case, the distribution of genotypes forms a finite cluster and moves arbitrarily in the space. (For example, try \\(N=200\\), \\(\\mu=0.0316\\), \\(k=50\\) and a zero fitness variance).",

For example, a bacterial cell may have to face both freezing temperatures and extreme warmth as the seasons change (or even during a day). Thus, a fitness landscape that changes with time is a more appropriate model for changing environments. A set of such interconnected fitness landscapes that switch between each other is sometimes called a fitness seascape.\nLike landscapes, fitness seascapes also come in different flavors, with the two most common ones being a moving fitness optimum and a strong-tradeoff seascape.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Two flavors of a fitness seascape. The moving optimum seascape shifts the fitness optima gradually as time passes. The strong-tradeoff seascape inverts the fitness benefits provided to a genotype as the environment changes.\n\n\nThe following simulation presents a 200-genotype space with either the moving optimum or tradeoff seascape, and with a finite population evolving on it.

    "text": "From fitness to phenotype\nKeeping track of how fitness changes across environments can be difficult. However, under certain permissive conditions, the phenotype of the organism (i.e., the set of traits it has) is the major determinant of how fit it is going to be in an environment. For example, whether or not a cell can produce a heat-shock protein determines its ability to survive in a hot environment. Thus, when discussing dynamic fitness landscapes, it is usually easier to assign fitness values through a genotype-phenotype map. The fitness landscape, which is essentially a genotype-fitness mapping can then be decomposed into a genotype-phenotype and phenotype-fitness mapping.\nThe primary advantage of this decomposition lies in the fact that the genotype-phenotype variant is generally invariant across environments, and a change in external conditions only changes how the phenotype translates to the rate of growth. Additionally, because the genotype-phenotype map is redundant (with multiple genotype having the same phenotype), it requires a far fewer number of fitness values to be measured. The following example shows an example of fitness landscapes that is decomposed this way.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: A fitness landscape decomposed into a genotype-phenotype and a phenotype-fitness map.

    "section": "A hint of evolvability",
    "text": "A hint of evolvability\nEvolvability is the idea that certain populations can be differentially reactive to changing selective pressures. Thus, the term can be used to capture a population’s capacity for adaptation. Whether the evolutionary process can enhance a population’s evolvability has been the topic of a great debate in the field of evolutionary biology. In recent work, we have shown that this enhancement does occur under certain environments and through multiple pathways. One of these pathways works via the localization of populations on phenotypic boundaries in the genotype space when the environment changes. This localization can be observed in the seascape simulation as well, but the results are slightly more striking in two dimensions.\nThe following simulation presents a two-dimensional genotype space on which a population can be seen evolving. Here, each pixel is a genotype and mutations only occur between adjacent genotypes. White squares are genotypes with no organisms, and the intensity of the color represents the concentration of organisms on a particular genotype. The sliders can be used to modify the population size, mutation rate, and speed of the simulation. Additionally, the user can drag their mouse around the space to draw what is referred to as a neutral network. A neutral network is a set of genotypes that have the same phenotype (and thus the same fitness). The relative fitness slider can be used to adjust the ratio of fitness of the neutral network genotypes to the rest of the genotype space.\nAs one can expect, drawing a neutral network with a high fitness immediately makes the population find and localize in this high fitness area of the genotype space. Further, using the time-average button will show you that most organisms in these neutral networks reside in the center of the network, far from the edges where mutations that decrease fitness are possible. This idea is sometimes referred to as mutational robustness.\nOn the other hand, something interesting happens when the environment is allowed to switch to a state where the neutral network genotypes now have a smaller fitness (which can be triggered by increasing the environment switching probability). Time averaging the population in this switching environment reveals an elevated fraction of organisms with genotypes on the boundary of the neutral network, where it interfaces with genotypes of a different phenotype. Thus, the environmental switching induces an interesting steady state where the population prefers parts of the genotype space where phenotype switching mutations are more likely. A changing environment can thus promote the evolution of evolvability in these populations!",

This interactive demo uses the Lorentz attractor to remix music recordings unpredictably, illustrating the creative potential of chaos.\n\n\n\nAn interactive simulation of flocking behavior demonstrating emergent phenomena.\n\n\n\nFitness landscapes, essential in evolutionary biology, help visualize how populations respond to natural selection. Unlike static images, our simulations allow users to interact with parameters like population size and mutation rates, and experiment with dynamic “seascapes” to understand evolution in changing environments and explore the concept of “evolvability.”\n\n\n\nConway’s Game of Life demonstrates how simple rules can generate complex behaviors on a 2-dimensional grid, where cells live or die based on their neighbors. This demo simulates the game, using sounds and a Novation Launchpad to create a unified physical, auditory, and visual experience, illustrating the emergence of complexity.\n\n\n\nAn example of collective painting, how many parts can make a new whole.\n\n\n\nBeauty often naturally emerges in research on complexity. Created to compile images and media generated by participants of this summer school as a starting point, this gallery aims to continue incorporating everyone’s complexity inspirations encountered during our tinkering.\n\n\n\nDesigned to travel to multiple locations and reach a diverse audience, the exhibition we propose offers an interactive experience, allowing visitors to touch and move physical objects, thereby humanizing complexity. It highlights the aesthetic dimensions and emergent properties of complex systems through networks of interactions, educational modules, and artistic installations. Visitors will be able to immerse themselves in the simplicity of complexity, exploring everything from biological microscopic systems to macroscopic classical physics. The exhibition’s design will enable participants to act both as spectators and integral parts of the system, illustrating the concept that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and that, as with complex systems, interactive art also defies complete predictability.\nAs accompanying material for the exhibition, the development of educational modules is suggested, using platforms such as Complexity Explorer, to disseminate the concepts presented in the exhibition. These modules will teach participants to transform their favorite complexity concepts into art objects, either physical or digital.\nIn essence, both the living digital archive and the exhibition aim to be a dynamic and visual collective exploration of complex systems, showing that science and art are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary ways through which we can appreciate the world.",
